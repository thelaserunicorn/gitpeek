## GitHub Commit Tracker CLI

A command-line tool written in **Go** that fetches and displays:
- The number of commits you‚Äôve made today and this week
- Commits grouped by repository

## Features

‚úÖ Fetches your repositories using GitHub API  
‚úÖ Lists your commits filtered by today/this week  
‚úÖ Shows commit messages and count  

---

## Requirements

- [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) 1.18 or newer  
- A **GitHub personal access token**

---


## Usage

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Set up your GitHub token and username in your terminal:

```bash
# Replace YOUR_TOKEN_HERE and YOUR_USERNAME_HERE
export GITHUB_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
export GITHUB_USERNAME=YOUR_USERNAME_HERE
```

üëâ To make this permanent, add those lines to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`:

```bash
echo 'export GITHUB_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export GITHUB_USERNAME=YOUR_USERNAME_HERE' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

If you use Zsh, update `~/.zshrc` instead.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Run the app

```bash
go run main.go
```

or build it:

```bash
go build -o gitpeek main.go
./gitpeek
```

---

## Example Output

```
=== TODAY'S COMMITS ===
Total commits: 3

    - Add unit tests for login
    - Refactor token handler

## Notes

- The tool uses the GitHub API v3. Make sure your token has at least `repo` scope for private repos.
- It fetches up to 100 commits per repo by default (GitHub API limit per request).
- TUI support can be extended using [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea).
